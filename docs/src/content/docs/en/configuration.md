## Page structure

Detailed configuration docs are split into standalone pages. Every left-sidebar item opens a page; the right outline is reserved for headings inside the current page. Main pages follow the app's left navigation order. Settings pages are grouped separately and follow the settings dialog order.

| Overview dashboard | System status, account balance, usage widgets, layout editing, and share cards |
| Provider config | Upstream services, protocol, Base URL, model list, and credentials |
| Agent Config | Agent launch method, model, scope, multi-instance launching, and Bot binding |
| API keys | Client access keys, expiration, and local limits |
| Logs and observability | Request logs, Agent execution traces, tool calls, and tool results |
| Server | Host, port, proxy mode, system proxy, network capture, and CA certificate |

## Content relationships

The overview dashboard shows system status and usage. Provider config covers how upstream model services enter AgentRouter. Agent Config covers launching, multi-instance use, and model selection for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Grok CLI, Kimi CLI, Kilo CLI, Pi, ZCode, and Claude Design. API keys control client access to AgentRouter. Logs and observability cover request logs and agent execution traces. Server controls the local gateway listener and proxy features. Config database location and tray configuration match the corresponding pages in the settings dialog.
