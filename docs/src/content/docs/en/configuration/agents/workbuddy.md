---

## Prerequisites

1. CCR Desktop is running with at least one provider + model configured.
2. WorkBuddy is installed on this machine. If CCR cannot detect it, set **APP_PATH** to the WorkBuddy executable.
3. You are on **Agent Config** and click **Add profile**.

## Create the profile

1. On **Agent Config**, click **Add profile** and choose **WorkBuddy**.
2. Enter a **Config name** (for example `WorkBuddy - Work`).
3. Confirm **Provider ID**, **Provider name**, and **WorkBuddy model**.
4. Optionally restrict **Allowed model list**. Leaving it empty makes every CCR model available in WorkBuddy.
5. Set **APP_PATH** only if auto-detection does not find WorkBuddy.
6. If you use AgentClaw, bind a **Bot**.
7. **Save**, then open WorkBuddy from CCR with the play button.

## Configuration reference

WorkBuddy is fixed to **App only**, so the entry mode is not editable. The fields you configure are:

| Field | How to set it | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent | Choose **WorkBuddy** | Creates a WorkBuddy App launch entry in CCR. |
| Config name | Free text, e.g. `WorkBuddy - Work` | Identifies the profile. Desktop commands use `agentrouter "<name>" app`; CLI commands use `ccr "<name>" app`. |
| Enabled | Toggle on/off | Disabled profiles are not applied and not offered as launch entries. |
| Effect scope | `Only opened from CCR` / `System default` | Keeps the profile limited to CCR launches, or makes it the system-default WorkBuddy profile. Only one enabled system-default WorkBuddy profile is allowed. |
| Provider ID | Default `claude-code-router` | Provider reference for this WorkBuddy profile. |
| Provider name | Free text; default `Claude Code Router` | Display name used by the generated profile. |
| WorkBuddy model | A provider model or Fusion model | Default model when WorkBuddy App opens. |
| Allowed model list | Optional multi-select | Controls which CCR models appear in WorkBuddy. Empty means all models. |
| APP_PATH | Optional executable path | Overrides app auto-detection. Use it when WorkBuddy is installed in a custom location. |
| Config file | Path | Used for the system-default WorkBuddy profile. |
| Environment variables | Key/value rows | Optional advanced overrides; leave empty for normal use. |
| Bot | Select a saved Bot | Binds an AgentClaw IM bot to the WorkBuddy App entry. |

## Model list behavior

WorkBuddy's model settings follow the profile's **Allowed model list**:

- If **Allowed model list** has selections, only those models are written.
- If **Allowed model list** is empty, every CCR model is available.
- The selected **WorkBuddy model** is used as the default model.

After changing providers or model lists, reopen WorkBuddy from CCR. If the WorkBuddy settings window is already open, close and reopen that window to refresh the list.

## Open and use

Click the play button on the profile card to open WorkBuddy with this profile's model, provider, and model list. Reopening the same profile activates the existing window.

Desktop App command copied from the profile card:

```text
agentrouter "WorkBuddy - Work" app
```

For CLI, run:

```text
ccr "WorkBuddy - Work" app
```

## Multi-instance

Create separate WorkBuddy profiles when you want different model lists or providers.

## AgentClaw (Bot)

With a Bot bound and WorkBuddy opened from CCR, WorkBuddy can relay activity through the selected IM channel. Closing WorkBuddy takes the relay offline. See [AgentClaw](/en/agentclaw/) for the full IM setup.

## Verify

1. Open WorkBuddy from CCR.
2. Open WorkBuddy **Models** settings and confirm the expected models are listed.
3. Send one message and confirm it replies.
4. Open **Request logs** in CCR and confirm the request passed through the gateway.

## Common issues

- **Only one model appears:** apply the WorkBuddy profile again and reopen WorkBuddy from CCR. Empty **Allowed model list** means all CCR models should be available.
- **Requests bypass CCR:** confirm the profile is **Enabled** and you opened WorkBuddy from CCR; reopen it from CCR if it was already running.
- **Wrong model in the App:** confirm the **WorkBuddy model** field and the model list in WorkBuddy settings.
- **WorkBuddy was not found:** set **APP_PATH** to the WorkBuddy executable.
