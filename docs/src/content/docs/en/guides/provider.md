lead: "The interactive panel at the top of this page connects to your running AgentRouter to add a provider directly. Prefer the desktop app? The steps below cover choosing a preset or custom endpoint, entering credentials, letting AgentRouter auto-detect protocols and models, and verifying with a connectivity check."
---

## Add the provider

1. Open **Providers** and click **Add Provider**.
2. Choose a built-in preset under **Select preset provider**. Presets fill common API endpoints, protocols, and icons automatically.
3. If the service is not listed, choose **Other / custom API endpoint** and enter a **Name** and **API endpoint**.
4. In the **Add credentials** step, enter the **API key**.

After you enter the API endpoint and key, AgentRouter automatically detects the protocols and models the endpoint supports. Preset providers hide the API endpoint field by default; override it in **Advanced settings** if needed.

## Protocols

The protocol decides which request format AgentRouter uses to talk to the upstream. It is chosen by auto-detection by default; use the table below when you need to pick manually.

| Protocol | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat | Most OpenAI-compatible services |
| OpenAI Responses | Services that support the Responses API |
| Anthropic Messages | Anthropic official or Anthropic-compatible services |
| Gemini Generate | Gemini official or Gemini-compatible services |
| Gemini Interactions | Services that support the Gemini Interactions protocol |

If auto-detection misses the mark, turn it off in **Advanced settings**, choose a protocol manually, and confirm with a connectivity check.

## Verify connectivity

Once credentials and models are in place, click **Check Connection**: AgentRouter sends a real request with the current API endpoint, key, protocol, and selected models to confirm the full path works. Output is length-limited, but it may still consume a few tokens or count toward provider-side request limits, so select only the models you need to confirm.

Save the provider once the check passes.

## Multiple keys and usage

For teams or high-frequency usage, switch to the **Credential pool** tab in the credentials step, add multiple upstream keys, and configure priority, weight, and limits. AgentRouter rotates between them according to your rules.

To show balance or remaining quota in the provider list, tray, or overview, turn on **Fetch usage** in the form, choose a usage mode, and test the field mapping.

For full details on credential limits and usage field mapping, see [Provider config](../../configuration/providers/).
