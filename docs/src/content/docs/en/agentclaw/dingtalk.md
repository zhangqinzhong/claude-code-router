## Who this is for

DingTalk is for bringing agent messages into an enterprise collaboration environment. AgentRouter connects to DingTalk apps using App Secret auth.

> New to AgentClaw? Read the AgentClaw overview and usage and configuration first, then come back here for a single platform.

## The fields you'll use

| Name in the DingTalk dashboard | AgentRouter field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client ID / AppKey | App Key | Required | App identifier |
| Client Secret / AppSecret | App Secret | Required | App secret |
| RobotCode | Robot Code | Optional | May be needed for multi-bot or media scenarios |

> Newer DingTalk configures the bot as an "app capability" — don't start from the old standalone "bot" entry.

## Step 1: Create a DingTalk app

1. Open the [DingTalk developer backend](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/).
2. Log in with your DingTalk account.
3. Pick the dev organization to connect.
4. Open `应用开发` (App Development) at the top.
5. Click `创建应用` (Create App).
6. Name it, e.g. `AgentRouter`.
7. Fill in the description; leave other options default.
8. Click create.

## Step 2: Copy the App Key and App Secret

1. Open the app you just created.
2. On the left, open `应用信息` (App Info) or `凭证与基础信息` (Credentials & Basic Info).
3. Copy `Client ID` for AgentRouter's App Key.
4. Copy `Client Secret` for AgentRouter's App Secret.

> The dashboard may still show the old names `AppKey` / `AppSecret` — map them by field name.

## Step 3: Enable the bot capability

1. In the app, open `机器人与消息推送` (Bot & Message Push), or open `应用能力` (App Capabilities) and choose `机器人` (Bot).
2. Enable `机器人配置` (Bot Config).
3. Fill in the bot name, avatar, and description.
4. Choose **Stream mode** for message receiving.
5. Save.
6. If the page shows a `RobotCode`, copy it for AgentRouter's Robot Code.

## Step 4: Publish the app and join a chat

1. Open `版本管理与发布` (Version Management & Release) and create a new version.
2. Set the visibility scope — for testing, choose just yourself or a test group.
3. Submit for release.
4. After release, search the bot name in the DingTalk client.
5. Open the bot chat, or add the bot to the target group via group settings.

## Wire it up in AgentRouter

1. Open AgentRouter's **Bot Management** page and click **Add Bot**.
2. Pick **DingTalk** as the platform.
3. Auth is **App Secret**.
4. Paste the Client ID into **App Key**.
5. Paste the Client Secret into **App Secret**.
6. If you copied a RobotCode, paste it into **Robot Code**.
7. Save the bot.
8. Open **Agent Profiles** and edit the Agent Profiles you want to attach it to.
9. Turn on **Bot** and select the bot.
10. Optionally enable **Forward agent messages** or **Handoff** (next section).
11. Reopen the agent from AgentRouter.

## Forward or handoff

- **Forward agent messages**: forwards regardless of lock state. Good when you want full output in DingTalk.
- **Handoff**: only forwards after the screen locks. Pair with Idle seconds and a target device.

> For lock-screen-only alerts, use **Handoff** without **Forward agent messages**.

## Test it

1. Open the agent from AgentRouter and trigger a message.
2. Check DingTalk to confirm the app received it and replied.
3. For groups, confirm the app or bot is in the target group and can post.

> **How to tell it worked:** DingTalk shows the agent's message, and replies keep the agent going.

## Common issues

- **Auth fails**: re-copy App Key and App Secret.
- **Bot-identifier errors**: check that Robot Code matches the platform dashboard.
- **Bot receives nothing**: confirm the bot capability is enabled in the app and the receive mode matches AgentRouter's config.
- **Users can't find the bot**: check that the app is published and the visibility scope includes the current user or group members.
- **Handoff doesn't trigger**: confirm the screen is locked, and check the Handoff toggle, idle time, and target device.
