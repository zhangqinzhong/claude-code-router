## Who this is for

LINE is for routing agent messages into an existing LINE friend list, group chat, or LINE Official Account. AgentRouter uses a Channel Access Token as the primary auth field.

> New to AgentClaw? Read the AgentClaw overview and usage and configuration first, then come back here for a single platform.

## The fields you'll use

In AgentRouter, LINE's auth type is labeled **Bot Token**, but you fill in these two channel fields:

| Name in the LINE dashboard | AgentRouter field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Channel access token | Channel Access Token | Required | Lets the bot call the LINE Messaging API |
| Channel secret | Channel Secret | Recommended | Used to verify requests from LINE |

## Step 1: Create a Messaging API channel

1. Open the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).
2. Log in with your LINE account.
3. Create a Provider, or pick an existing one.
4. Click `Create a new channel`.
5. Choose `Messaging API`.
6. Fill in the Channel name, description, icon, category, etc.
7. Open the channel after it's created.

> If you already have a LINE Official Account, you can enable Messaging API in its settings, then come back to the console to copy credentials.

## Step 2: Copy the Channel Secret

1. Open the Messaging API channel you just created.
2. Open `Basic settings`.
3. Find `Channel secret` and copy it for AgentRouter's Channel Secret.

## Step 3: Issue a Channel Access Token

1. Open the `Messaging API` tab.
2. Find `Channel access token`.
3. Click `Issue` or `Reissue`.
4. Copy the generated token for AgentRouter's Channel Access Token.

> Prefer a long-lived token. Reissuing invalidates the old token, so update AgentRouter at the same time.

## Step 4: Open the chat entry

1. For groups, turn on `Allow bot to join group chats`.
2. Consider disabling the LINE Official Account auto-reply so users don't get both the default reply and the agent's.

## Wire it up in AgentRouter

1. Open AgentRouter's **Bot Management** page and click **Add Bot**.
2. Pick **LINE** as the platform.
3. Auth is **Bot Token** (this is LINE's fixed auth type in AgentRouter).
4. Paste the token into **Channel Access Token**.
5. Paste the secret into **Channel Secret**.
6. Save the bot.
7. Open **Agent Profiles** and edit the Agent Profiles you want to attach it to.
8. Turn on **Bot** and select the bot.
9. Optionally enable **Forward agent messages** or **Handoff** (next section).
10. Reopen the agent from AgentRouter.

## Forward or handoff

- **Forward agent messages**: forwards regardless of lock state. Good when you want full output in LINE.
- **Handoff**: only forwards after the screen locks. Pair with Idle seconds and a target device.

> For lock-screen-only alerts, use **Handoff** without **Forward agent messages**.

## Test it

1. Open the agent from AgentRouter and trigger a message.
2. Check LINE to confirm the bot received it and replied.
3. For groups, confirm the bot has joined and can post.

> **How to tell it worked:** LINE shows the agent's message, and replies keep the agent going.

## Common issues

- **Auth fails**: re-copy the Channel Access Token.
- **Can send but can't receive**: confirm the Channel Access Token is valid and AgentRouter is running and connected to LINE.
- **Groups don't work**: confirm `Allow bot to join group chats` is on, then re-add the bot to the group.
- **Lock-screen-only alerts**: use Handoff without Forward agent messages.
