## Who this is for

Discord is for routing agent messages into a server channel, a private collab server, or a personal DM. A Bot Token is the most common setup and is straightforward.

## The fields you'll use

| Name in the Discord dashboard | AgentRouter field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Token | Bot Token | Required | The bot token from the Bot page |
| Application ID | Application ID | Optional | App ID from General Information |
| Public Key | Public Key | Optional | May be needed for interaction callbacks |

A Bot Token is usually enough. Only choose OAuth 2.0 if your flow explicitly requires it.

## Step 1: Create the Discord app and bot

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click `New Application`.
3. Name it, e.g. `AgentRouter`.
4. Open the app after it's created.
5. Open `Bot` on the left.
6. If there's no bot yet, click `Add Bot`.
7. Set the avatar and username.

## Step 2: Enable the required intents

1. Still on the `Bot` page, find `Privileged Gateway Intents`.
2. Enable **Message Content Intent**. Without it, the bot likely can't see message bodies.
3. Enable **Server Members Intent** if you gate on members, roles, or usernames.
4. **Presence Intent** is usually unnecessary unless you read online status.

## Step 3: Copy the Bot Token

1. On the `Bot` page, find `Token`.
2. Click `Reset Token` or `Copy`.
3. On first creation, `Reset Token` generates the first token — it doesn't mean you broke anything.
4. Copy the token for AgentRouter's Bot Token.

> This token is effectively the bot's password. Don't post it in Discord or paste it into an agent prompt.

## Step 4: Invite the bot into a server

1. Open `OAuth2` on the left.
2. Open `URL Generator`.
3. In `Scopes`, tick `bot` and `applications.commands`.
4. In `Bot Permissions`, tick at least `View Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Embed Links`, `Attach Files`.
5. Tick `Add Reactions` if you want reactions on approval messages.
6. Copy the generated URL, open it in a browser, and authorize into the target server.

## Step 5: Copy optional fields (if needed)

If something asks for Application ID or Public Key:

1. Go back to the Discord Developer Portal.
2. Open the app's `General Information`.
3. Copy `Application ID` and `Public Key`.

## Wire it up in AgentRouter

1. Open AgentRouter's **Bot Management** page and click **Add Bot**.
2. Pick **Discord** as the platform.
3. Keep the default **Bot Token** auth.
4. Paste the token into **Bot Token**.
5. Add **Application ID** and **Public Key** if needed.
6. Save the bot.
7. Open **Agent Profiles** and edit the Agent Profiles you want to attach it to.
8. Turn on **Bot** and select the bot.
9. Optionally enable **Forward agent messages** or **Handoff** (next section).
10. Reopen the agent from AgentRouter.

## Forward or handoff

- **Forward agent messages**: forwards regardless of lock state. Good for debugging or full-record channels.
- **Handoff**: only forwards after the screen locks. Pair with Idle seconds and a target device.

> For lock-screen-only alerts, use **Handoff** without **Forward agent messages**.

## Test it

1. Open the agent from AgentRouter and trigger a message.
2. Check Discord to confirm the bot received it and replied.
3. For server channels, confirm the bot is in the server and can post.

> **How to tell it worked:** Discord shows the agent's message, and replies keep the agent going.

## Common issues

- **Bot doesn't respond**: confirm the Bot Token was copied correctly.
- **Bot is online but can't see your messages**: check that Message Content Intent is on.
- **No messages in a channel**: confirm the bot is in that server and channel permissions let it post.
- **No permission options in the invite URL**: make sure the OAuth2 URL Generator has `bot` scoped.
- **Handoff doesn't trigger**: confirm the screen is locked, Handoff is on, and idle time/target device are set.
